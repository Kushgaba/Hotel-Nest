# Hotel-Nest

## **Project Description**
Hotel Nest is a hotel management application built using Android Studio. It allows users to search for hotels based on city, check-in and check-out dates, and the number of rooms. The app uses Firebase Authentication for OTP-based login and Firebase Realtime Database for data storage and retrieval.

## **Features**
**OTP-Based Authentication:** Secure user login using Firebase Authentication.
**Search Functionality:** Users can enter a city, check-in and check-out dates, and the number of rooms to find available hotels.
**Hotel Listing:** Displays a list of hotels fetched from the Firebase Realtime Database based on the user's search criteria.
**Checkout Screen:** Shows selected rooms, total bill calculation based on room selections and the number of days between check-in and check-out, along with user details (name, phone, email) entered during authentication.
**Browse Cities:** Users can explore different cities and view their details.

## **Architecture**
The app implements the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture for better separation of concerns and improved testability.
